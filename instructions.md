Notes: 

- on line 22 in pacakge-lock.json i added this to the devDependencies because npm run client compilied an error: "@babel plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object"

- line 45 in package.json i added "babel-jest":"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" after npm run client displated error message saying there is a bug in babel that won't be fixed.
